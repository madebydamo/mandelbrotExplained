        z_n+1 = z_n^2 + c<br>
        This formula captures the whole generated fracture. But where do the colors come from? And how do we generate
        this image? <br>
        Let us explore this wonderful Beauty in this exploratory website. Buckle your seatbelts!

      <h2 class="title">What is complex number squared?</h2>
      <div class="content"><canvas id="complexSqr"></canvas></div>
      <div class="text">
        A complex number (a + bi) squared equals (a + bi)^2 = (a^2 + 2abi - b^2). This doesn't seem intuitiv.<br>
        Do you find the the relation between and (a + bi) and (a + bi)^2? Compare the Angles and Magnitude in the unit
        cirlce on the left<br>

      <h2 class="title">How do we get the next iteration?</h2>
      <div class="content"><canvas id="pointiter"></canvas></div>
      <div class="text">
        Now lets return to our original formula z_n+1 = z_n^2 + c<br>
        Important to note is that z_0 = c. But what is c?<br>
        It is the starting point of the iteration and it doesn't change.<br>
        Let us visualize the iteration for an arbitrary point.<br>
        See how some points c seem to escape to infinity and some converge.<br>

      <h2 class="title">But where does the color come from?</h2>
      <div class="content"><canvas id="pointitercolor"></canvas></div>
      <div class="text">
        As you saw, some points escape to infinity, others converge.<br>
        Now how about we give every point a color, by how long he needs to escape to infinity?<br>
        Thats already how we generate the beautyful fraction.<br>
        The Mandelbrot Set contains all the points that converge. They are typically drawn as black<br>
        So the colors you see in the image are points that go to infinity by different speeds<br>

        One particular fascinating thing about the mandelbrot you will discover, when you zoom in.<br>
        In theory, you can draw the fractal as deep as you want. On this website its only possible to zoom in, until we
        reach the floating point accuracy. <br>
        But nonetheless an awesome adventure. <br>
