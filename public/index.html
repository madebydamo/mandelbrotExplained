        This formula is the essence of this generated fractal. But where do the colors come from? And how do we generate
        it? <br>
        Let us explore this wonderful beauty in this exploratory website. Buckle your seatbelts and scroll down! <br>

      <h2 class="title">How do we start?</h2>
      <div class="content"><canvas id="complexSqr"></canvas></div>
      <div class="text">
        Let us see how we get from $z_0$ to $z_1$. Our mouse determines the c, a complex number.
        This also is our $z_0$, the starting point of our iteration. So $z_0 = c$.
        Now according to our formula, $z_1 = z_0^2 + c$.
        We visualized $z_0 = c$, $z_0^2$ and $z_1$, so you can get a feeling for what is going on.
        <!-- A complex number $(a + bi)$ squared is $(a + bi)^2 = (a^2 + 2abi - b^2)$. This doesn't seem intuitive.<br> -->
        <!--     Can you find the the relation between and $(a + bi)$ and $(a + bi)^2$? Compare the Angles and Magnitude in the unit -->
        <!-- cirlce on the left<br> -->

      <h2 class="title">What happens if we continue the iteration?</h2>
      <div class="content"><canvas id="pointiter"></canvas></div>
      <div class="text">
        <!-- Now let's return to our original formula $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$<br> -->
        <!-- It is important to note that $z_0 = c$. But what is c?<br> -->
        <!-- It is the starting point of the iteration and it doesn't change.<br> -->
        Now that we know how to start the iteration, lets see what happens when we continue it.
        Now we visualize not only $z_0$ and $z_1$ but all $z_i$ until $i=50$.
        See how some points $c$ seem to let the equation escape to infinity.<br>

      <h2 class="title">But where does the color come from?</h2>
      <div class="content"><canvas id="pointitercolor"></canvas></div>
      <div class="text">
          As you saw, some points escape to infinity, others tend to stay around the unit circle.<br>
          Now, let's color every point $c$ according to how long it takes for the equation to escape to infinity.<br>
          That's how we generate this beautiful fractal.<br>
          The Mandelbrot Set contains all the points that don't diverge. They are typically drawn as black.<br>
          So the colors you see in the image are points that go to infinity at different speeds.<br>
          As a little sidenote, how we determine if a point escapes to infinity is pretty simple.
          If the magnitude of a point $z_n$ is greater then 2, we know it goes to infinity.
          A rigorous proof can be found <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/890190/mandelbrot-sets-and-radius-of-convergence">here</a>.<br>
          As an intuitive explanation you can think of $\vert z_{n+1}\vert > \vert z_n \vert^2 - \vert c \vert$ for $\vert c \vert < 2$ and $\vert z_n \vert > 2$.
          So if the magnitude of z_n only increases, the point must diverge.

        You will discover another fascinating thing about the Mandelbrot set when you zoom in.<br>
        In theory, you can draw the fractal as deep as you want. On this website it's only possible to zoom in, until we
        reach the floating point accuracy. <br>
        But nonetheless this will be an awesome adventure. <br>
