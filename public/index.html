        This formula captures the whole generated fractal. But where do the colors come from? And how do we generate
        this image? <br>
        Let us explore this wonderful beauty in this exploratory website. Buckle your seatbelts and scroll down!

      <div class="content"><canvas id="complexSqr"></canvas></div>
      <div class="text">
        A complex number (a + bi) squared is (a + bi)^2 = (a^2 + 2abi - b^2). This doesn't seem intuitive.<br>
        Can you find the the relation between and (a + bi) and (a + bi)^2? Compare the Angles and Magnitude in the unit
        cirlce on the left<br>

      <div class="content"><canvas id="pointiter"></canvas></div>
      <div class="text">
        Now let's return to our original formula z_n+1 = z_n^2 + c<br>
        It is important to note that z_0 = c. But what is c?<br>
        It is the starting point of the iteration and it doesn't change.<br>
        Let us visualize the iteration for an arbitrary point.<br>
        See how some points c seem to escape to infinity and some converge.<br>

      <h2 class="title">But where does the color come from?</h2>
      <div class="content"><canvas id="pointitercolor"></canvas></div>
      <div class="text">
        As you saw, some points escape to infinity, others converge.<br>
        Now, let's give every point a color, depending on how long it takes to escape to infinity.<br>
        That's how we generate this beautiful fractal.<br>
        The Mandelbrot Set contains all the points that converge. They are typically drawn as black<br>
        So the colors you see in the image are points that go to infinity at different speeds<br>

        You will discover another fascinating thing about the Mandelbrot set when you zoom in.<br>
        In theory, you can draw the fractal as deep as you want. On this website it's only possible to zoom in, until we
        reach the floating point accuracy. <br>
        But nonetheless this is an awesome adventure. <br>
